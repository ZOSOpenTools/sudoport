# Sudo on z/OS - Readme

## Introduction
Sudo is a powerful utility that enables running commands with the privileges of another user, typically root. 
This readme provides essential information for installing and using Sudo on z/OS, focusing on 
installation requirements and best practices.

## Special Installation Instructions
Unlike many of the z/OS Open Tools, sudo requires post-installation steps to be performed using
elevated privileges. 
These instructions are printed out at the end of a standard install and explain how to copy the 
binaries to your /usr/bin and /usr/sbin directories. 
The instructions also explain where you can read more about sudo in general.
